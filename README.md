# glsl-editor

A clone of [shadertoy](//www.shadertoy.com) because their UI sucks. 
Hosted [here](//nest.place/glsl)

This is merely a bit of custom styling over these excellent projects by other people:

- [highlight.js](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/)
- [code-input](https://github.com/WebCoder49/code-input)
- [glslCanvas](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslCanvas)

Note that these have been modified/minified quite a bit, so if anything has broken, it's probably my fault.
